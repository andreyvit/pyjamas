==================
Installing Pyjamas
==================

BEFORE PROCEEDING READ THE FOLLOWING WARNING.

DO NOT install the pyjamas libraries into /usr/share/python-support,
/usr/lib/python2.N/site-packages or ANY location where the "standard"
python interpreter could possibly pick them up.  The pyjamas libraries
have nothing to do with python libraries when used by the compiler,
and contain replacements for sys.py, time.py and other modules that
are critical to pyjamas.   It goes without saying that if you overwrite
the standard python modules with the pyjamas equivalents, you will run into
massive problems.  Don't do it.

Developer Sandbox Setup
=======================

In this directory run:

 python bootstrap.py

The files ``pyjd/__init__.py``, ``./bin/pyjsbuild`` and ``./bin/pyjscompile``
will be created, custom-tailored with hard-coded paths specific to the exact
absolute location that the bootstrap.py command is run from.  In this way, you
will be able to install, test and use multiple versions of Pyjamas, without
cross-interference.

As they contain hard-coded paths, these custom-tailored commands CANNOT
be "moved around".  If you move the pyjamas installation, re-run bootstrap.py
to recreate the commands, with suitable hard-coded paths.

To build pyjamas apps see ``./bin/pyjsbuild --help``


System Installation
===================

If you are installing pyjamas system-wide, for use by MORE THAN ONE
developer of the same multi-user system, run the following command.
Otherwise DO NOT run setup.py, see bootstrap.py.  If you are using Windows,
you are out of luck and should entirely avoid using setup.py.

First, you must use bootstrap.py to create suitable ./bin/pyjsbuild
and ./bin/pyjscompile commands.  For example:

 python boostrap.py /usr/bin /usr/share/pyjamas

After ./pyjd/__init__.py, ./bin/pyjsbuild and ./bin/pyjscompile have been
created, they can now be installed system-wide, along with the libraries.

 python run_bootstrap_first_then_setup.py install

You *may* need to specify --install-data={pickasuitablelocation}
and you *may* need to specify the same location to the bootstrap.py
command (prior to running run_bootstrap_first_then_setup.py)

 python bootstrap.py /usr/bin {pickasuitablelocation}

The commands pyjscompile and pyjsbuild will be installed;
the boilerplate web templates, the pyjamas "builtin" libraries
and the UI Widget libraries will be installed as data libraries
which pyjscompile and pyjsbuild will know about.   The default
path is:

    {sys.prefix}/share/pyjamas

You can over-ride this default location with the PYJSPREFIX
environment variable.
