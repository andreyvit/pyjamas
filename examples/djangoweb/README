The WebPage application allows editing of basic web pages.
Its closest equivalent is "googlepages".  The application is -
surprise - pure javascript.  Therefore, once a page has been loaded
from the server via the django JSONRPC service, it need not ever
be loaded again (unless the user refreshes the whole site).

When editing pages, Links containing "#pagename" are converted into
pyjamas Hyperlink widgets.  Hyperlink widgets trigger onHistoryChanged.
As the "History" technique is used, browser history (back, forward)
is preserved.

A very brief walk through of how to get WebPage running:

Create the db:

    * mysql -u root
    * > CREATE DATABASE webpages;
    * > grant all privilages to webpages.* to 'webpages'@'localhost'; (or possibly > grant all on webpages.* to 'webpages'@'localhost';)
    * > exit;

Create the tables:

    * cd djangoweb
    * python manage.py syncdb

Add fckeditor

    * go find fckeditor on the internet
    * copy fckeditor (or symlink) to public/fckeditor

Build the javascript:

    * vim media/build.sh
    * (edit this so that it points to the build.py of pyjamas)
    * media/build.sh

Run the server:

    * python manage.py runserver

Test it out:

    * To enter the "admin" interface, goto:
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/site_media/output/WebPage.html?#admin

    * To "view" the site: In your browser, goto:
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/site_media/output/WebPage.html
