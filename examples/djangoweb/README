A very brief walk through of how to get this running:

Create the db:

    * mysql -u root
    * > CREATE DATABASE webpages;
    * > grant all privilages to webpages.* to 'webpages'@'localhost'; (or possibly > grant all on webpages.* to 'webpages'@'localhost';)
    * > exit;

Create the tables:

    * cd djangoweb
    * python manage.py syncdb

Build the javascript:

    * vim media/build.sh
    * (edit this so that it points to the build.py of pyjamas)
    * media/build.sh

Run the server:

    * python manage.py runserver

Test it out:

    * In your browser, goto: http://127.0.0.1:8000/site_media/output/WebPage.html
