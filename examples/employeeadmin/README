This example of the EmployeeAdmin is based on the wxPython version 
by Toby de Havilland <toby.de.havilland@puremvc.org>

To show what needs to be altered, it is as close as it can be to the original 
wxPython version.

For larger applications, it would be better to put the constants in a
separate file, e.g. ApplicationConstants.py

It would also be advisable to make directories with model/controller/view and
components.

In order to run this example, You'll need to download PureMVC for Python. 
At the moment of this writing available at:
http://puremvc.org/pages/downloads/Python/PureMVC_Python.zip

To compile the application, the library path must include the puremvc 
files. E.g.:
 ../../bin/pyjsbuild --library_dir "`pwd`/PureMVC_Python_1_0/src" EmployeeAdmin
