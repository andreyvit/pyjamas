Erik gets a special mention for the contribution of the "Showcase".

Luis did the porting of gtk to pyjamas: I'm sorry we haven't had time
to reincorporate it into pyjamas 0.4 or above yet, Luis!  It'll happen
eventually.

Bernd's work on the core python compiler has been absolutely invaluable.

G Clinch ported the DisclosurePanel from GWT

Kees Boss added multiple inheritance support and has just gone mad with
the python-esque improvements since.

Laszlo Krekacs has been adding little bits of language support, and also
ported Toggle, Custom and Push buttons from GWT 1.6

Stefan is a recent contributor since Europython and has been adding
"formal correctness" patches that are more in line with python 2.5 and 2.6
and python coding standards.

Radoslav created a couple of examples, lightout and processingjs

James - thank you for kick-starting this project.

Henk Punt, for pyjd/windows.py - this saved an enormous dependency
(pywin32, at 5mb) for the MSHTML port.

Scott Graham for the work in Skulpt on the parser/translator

And of course, a huge amount of thanks goes to Google and the engineers
there that produced GWT, on which pyjamas is originally based.
