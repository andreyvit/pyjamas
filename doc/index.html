<h2> About <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">pyjamas</span></h2>
<big><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span>
 <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">Pyjamas</span>
</big>
is a port of
<a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web
Toolkit</a> to Python.
(<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=239074">Download Pyjamas 0.6</a>).  Read the <a href="./FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and the

<h2> What is <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153);">pyjamas</span>?</h2>
 <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span>
is a stand-alone python to javascript compiler, an AJAX framework / library
and a Widget set API.

<h2> Why should I use it? </h2>
<p>
You can write web applications in python - a readable programming language -
instead of in HTML and Javascript, both of which become quickly unreadable
for even medium-sized applications.  Your application's design can benefit
from encapsulating high level concepts into classes and modules (instead
of trying to fit as much HTML as you can stand into one page); you can
reuse - and import - classes and modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, the AJAX library takes care of all the browser interoperability
issues on your behalf, leaving you free to focus on application development
instead of learning all the "usual" browser incompatibilities.
</p>

<h2> What do other developers say about Pyjamas? </h2>

"Thanks for developing this, it seems like a much "healthier" way to do
web development,"

<h2>Overview</h2>
Like GWT,&nbsp;<big><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span></big>
involves the translation of the application and libraries (including UI
widgets and DOM classes) to Javascript and the packaging up of that
Javascript code.<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="0"
 cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>There are two core developer tools included with&nbsp;<big><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span></big>.
&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">pyjs</span><img
 style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="[1]" src="img/num1.png">
translates Python code to Javascript by walking the Python abstract
syntax tree and generating Javascript.<br>
      <br>
In many cases, built-in Python types require a custom Javascript
implementation. &nbsp;For example, even though Python lists are similar
to
Javascript arrays, Python lists are converted to custom objects that
implement methods such as <i>append</i>. &nbsp;These custom objects,
required for translation <span style="font-weight: bold;">by pyjs</span>,
are defined in a library called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">pyjslib</span>.<img
 style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="[2]" src="img/num2.png"><br>
      <br>
Like GWT,&nbsp;<big><span
 style="color: rgb(102, 0, 153); font-weight: bold;">pyjamas</span></big>
comes with a set of UI widgets as well as a library for DOM
manipulation.<img style="width: 23px; height: 22px;" alt="[3]"
 src="img/num3.png"> &nbsp;These libraries are written in Python but
are, like everything else, translated to Javascript for deployment.<br>
      <br>
The overall translation of individual components is managed by build<img
 style="width: 22px; height: 22px;" alt="[4]" src="img/num4.png">
which also creates the necessary boilerplate code. &nbsp;The result is
a set of <span style="font-family: monospace;">.html</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">.js</span> files that can be served up
by a Web server.<br>
      <br>
There are other components planned which have not been covered here
such as server-side code for communication in client-server
applications.  The examples do however contain JSONRPC server-side
source code (in cgi python, and php) which give an idea of what's
involved.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    Pyjamas is slightly different from traditional Web development: it's
    more like Desktop application development.  Emphasising this and
    helping you to begin developing your first application, is a
    <a href="./getting_started.html">getting started</a> page.  Also,
    a more comprehensive and direct guide to getting started is in
    the online <a href="./book/output/Bookreader.html#Getting%20Started">Pyjamas Book</a>.
</p>

<h2>Building User Interfaces with Pyjamas</h2>
The
<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight:bold">ui</span> module
contains all of the main classes you need to create your user interface.  At
first, this module can be a quite confusing because of the number of classes
defined.  To become familiar with
the user interface side of Pyjamas, you might like to refer to the <a
href="showcase/Showcase.html">Pyjamas User Interface Showcase</a>.  You
might find the <a href="uiHierarchy.html">ui module class hierarchy</a> useful.

Additionally, there is <a href="http://pyjd.sf.net/api">API documentation</a>
on <a href="http://pyjd.sf.net">pyjd.org</a>, along with a
<a href="http://pyjd.sf.net/controls_tutorial.html">tutorial</a> on how to
create your own interactive widget.

<h2>Pyjamas Book</h2>

An online version of the
<a href="./book/output/Bookreader.html">Pyjamas Book</a>
is available to read, and is in development.  Contact <a href="mailto:lkcl@lkcl.net">lkcl@lkcl.net</a> if there are any issues that you believe should be
covered; if you find any errors; or if the book proves useful enough to
be worth paying for.  The Bookreader itself is a Pyjamas application
which uses AJAX to load the contents as text files, and Wiki-like markup
is used, on the browser, to generate the HTML displayed.

<h2>Download</h2>
Pyjamas can be downloaded from sourceforge,
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=239074">here</a>.
The current release is 0.6.  Latest source code in development
is available from sourceforge subversion,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=239074">here</a>.

<h2>Developer advice, and setting up a development environment</h2>

<p>
Web application development can be tricky: it can come as a bit of a shock
when compared to python app development to learn that web browsers do not
come with <i>any</i> proper debugging assistance whatsoever, by default.
You <b>will</b> need to install and/or enable a debugger in the browsers
that you use:
</p>

<ul>
<li /> For Firefox, install both Venkman and Firebug.
<li /> For IE, install the "Microsoft Script Debugger".
<li /> For Safari, go to the settings and enable "Development".
<li /> Opera users, you are extremely lucky: opera has stack tracing by default.
</ul>

<p>
You should also note that the Pyjamas compiler has a "-d" option which
will enable a python-like stack trace when a javascript exception occurs.
The amount of javascript generated can be FIVE times larger, so only enable
this during development.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it is worth reiterating that Pyjamas-Desktop runs as pure python:
you should give serious consideration to running the application under
Pyjamas-Desktop alongside developing it for the browser.  The availability
of python runtime stack traces and the simple fact that the standard python
interpreter is much better at catching certain kinds of errors than 
(brain-damaged) browsers has generally found to make life much much easier.
</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>
<li /><b>17th August 2009</b> The MSHTML Pyjamas-Desktop port takes
shape!  Various interesting technical challenges have been mostly
overcome, to bring IE's engine to the mix.  This is <i>not</i> the
same approach as, for example,
<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/appcelerator-platform/titanium-architecture/">Titanium</a>, which enables &lt;script type="text/python" /&gt;.
The MSHTML port of Pyjamas Desktop actually embeds an IWebBrowser2
Active-X instance into a Win32 window, provides access to the Document
of the IWebBrowser2 using Python/COM, and goes from there.  In other
words, other than the python
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/comtypes">"comtypes"</a> package, which
is only 140k, and IE itself, there are no additional dependencies required
to get pyjamas applications running under MSHTML.
<li /><b>6th July 2009</b> Pyjamas compiles the Python version of
<a href="http://trac.puremvc.org/PureMVC_Python/">PureMVC</a>.  Kees Bos
improved the pyjamas compiler to the point where PureMVC would compile
to Javascript and run with zero modifications.  He has also ported
the <a href="./examples/employeeadmin">Employee Admin</a> wxWidgets
example to run under Pyjamas, and it is close to working under PyJD as well.
<li /><b>2nd July 2009</b> Pyjamas Desktop is ported to run under XUL,
the Browser engine behind Mozilla Firefox.  Thanks to Hulahop (from the
OLPC Sugar team) and to the developers of python-xpcom, Pyjamas Desktop
was successfully ported to XUL in only two days.
