"""
* This class' sole purpose is to work around a FF 2
* performance limitation: chart update times increase as
* O(N^2) after the number of direct ancestor child widgets in
* a single AbsolutePanel exceeds around 500-1000, AND the
* chart is updated in more than one browser-displayed stage
* (e.g, via a series of incremental updates that successively
* add more curve data, for purposes of user feedback). By
* contrast, IE7 times grow as O(N) even if 3,000 child widgets
* are added to a previously displayed chart (e.g. by adding a
* bar curve with 3,000 bars on it).
*
* <p>
*
* For solid-fill line chart support (LINE SymbolType
* introduced in 2.2), thousands of widgets are often needed
* and so these O(N^2) FF 2 times were just too slow.
*
* <p>
*
* Some kind of fixed hash table inside of FF 2 divs could
* explain this switch from O(N) to O(N^2) performance.
* <p>
*
* Approach is to split up the large AbsolutePanel into a
* series of child panels, each of which contains a number of
* elements within the range where FF 2 updates are O(N).
* <p>
*
* Tried to keep it light-weight so IE7 isn't penalized too
* much for having to workaround this FF 2 limitation.

    determined FF 2 O(N) range. Here's the data (from a 3,000 element
    test based on the sin curve of the 2.1 live demo
    called GChartExample15c.java) upon which this choice was based:

    2      11     13

    </pre>
    <p>

    The two largest sizes are good approximations of FF2 times we got
    informally before the switch to partitioned AbsolutePanels with
    charts with the corresponding number of elements (2000 or 3000).
    The overhead of the partitioning itself is very low, as shown by
    the modest time increase even when each element is placed into
    its own sub-panel. Tests with a < 256 element chart suggested at
    most a couple of ms of time increases due to the introduction of
    partitioning.

    <p>

    I kind of expected to see >61 second times with a sub-panel size
    of 1, since the parent panel still has >3,000 elements in this
    case. Whatever the cause of the performance logjam (presumably in
    the FF2 heap somewhere?)  simply the fact that you introduce a
    parent AbsolutePanel that holds various child AbslolutePanels
    that hold the actual image widgets appears to work around most of
    the problem. If such a useless change makes FF2 materially
    faster, that seems like a performance bug in FF2 to me.<p>

    The root FF cause is apparently NOT image cache related, though,
    since turning off the image cache via about:config didn't change
    times for the last row of the table above.

        * positioned exactly as it would have been in the
        * paragraph had the normal text been visible, except that
        * the normal text <i>isn't</i> visible. And, unlike
        * transparent text, the invisible text also won't capture
        * mouse events (essential for our aligned labels)
        *
        * <p>
        *
        * With GChart's aligned label, we want the outter Grid (HTML
        * table) to be "not there" as far as visibility and
        * mouseovers, but still impact centering and
        * other alignment of the stuff in the visible, inner Grid.
        *
        * <p>
        *
        * Note that we cannot just make the Grid color transparent
        * (tried that first) because in that case the oversized
        * outter Grid required for alignment will still grab the
        * mouseover events inappropriately (wrong hovertext
        * problem).
        *
        * <p>

        * Not certain but, apparently, IE6 requires that, if

        * is a table you must use another table as the
        * inner element. At least, the div inner element approach
        * I used at first (that basically worked in Firefox), made
        * both parent and child invisible in IE6.
        * <p>

        * Well, that's the theory. But GChart's mouse tracking has
        * only been tested for the case where <tt>update</tt> is
        * always called just before the developer cedes control back
        * to the browser after making a series of chart spec changes.
        * So, the docs warn developers to be sure that they do
        * that, too. But the hope is that specialized applications
        * where they don't call update until the user explicitly asks
        * for that (say, for a very busy chart with an editing
        * capability and a "refresh" button) will also work OK.
        *
        * <p>
        *
        * Another important consequence of this "track but don't act"
        * approach is that it assures that only cheap/quick
        * operations can be triggered automatically by direct user
        * mousing. Potentially expensive "full chart" updates always
        * require a direct developer update invocation. So, if the
        * system "locks up while it's doing a lengthly update" there
        * will always be an actual developer line of code responsible
        * for that, not some mysteriously event-triggered call.
