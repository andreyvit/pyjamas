    * Separates points on this curve into bins associated with

    * <p>
    *
    * Because busy charts typically distribute points evenly
    * across the chart, by jumping to the appropriate band's
    * list, we can (usually) greatly accelerate worst case mouse
    * hit testing. And because the bin organizing step only
    * requires a single pass over all the points (and less than a
    * two int memory overhead per point) it should almost always
    * be a "good deal" performance-wise (compared to a simple
    * full point-list scan with every hit test).<p>
    *
    * Points are placed into bins based on the (pixel) position
    * of the x (or, with horizontal bands, y) at the center of
    * the rendered symbol.  We choose bin size to guarantee that
    * bins are at least as wide (or high, for horizontally banded
    * hit testing) as the rendered symbols on this curve. This
    * simplifies hit testing, since bins are big enough to assure
    * that a single symbol straddles at most two adjacent bands.
    * Exploits fact that all symbols on the same curve have the
    * same size, and that curves with many points on them tend to
    * have smaller sized symbols.
    *
    * <p>
    *
    * Note that, for bin placement purposes, pie slices are
    * considered to have a "center" equal to the center of the
    * pie that contains them, and to have a width and height
    * equal to the diameter of the pie containing the slice
    * (the "worst-case slice").
    *
    * <p>
    *
    * Also note that a symbol whose center is in the right side
    * of a vertical band may overlap into the following band, and
    * one in the left side may overlap the preceding band. Thus
    * during hit testing, we must check not only the lists of
    * points in the bands "touched" by the mouse-cursor-centered
    * brush, but also 1) the band to the immediate left of the
    * leftmost touched band, whenever a left-side sub-band of that band
    * is touched by the brush and 2) the band to the immediate
    * right of the rightmost touched band, whenever a right-side
    * sub-band of that band is touched. The thickness of these left
    * and right side sub-bands equals half the symbol width.
    * Expanding the brush a half-symbol width on either edge
    * is the easiest way to apply these rules. Exactly
    * analogous statements apply to horizontal bands.  <p>
    *
    * A minimum band size is enforced to prevent the number of
    * bands from growing too large with small symbols. Each
    * symbol type defines if vertical or horizontal banding is
    * more appropriate, or if brush shape should determine
    * banding strategy (as of this writing, only horizontal bar
    * symbol types require horizontal hit-test bands).  Exploits the
    * fact that all symbols have a fixed size for at least one of
    * their dimensions (for example, vertical bars have variable
    * height but fixed width).<p>
    *
    * Note: this method must be called after the curve is
    * rendered during an update(), to assure that hit-test-bins
    * are consistent with rendered curves, and ready for use
    * before the first mouse hit testing is done.
    * <p>
    *
    * After running this method, points on this curve within a given
    * band can be enumerated as in the following code:
    * <p>
