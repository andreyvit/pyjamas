After the europython merge we have still some things to change.

- fix all example build scripts

- test all examples

- move all python library modules implemented for js into pyjs/lib

- move all builtin modules implemented for js into pyjs/builtin

- fix v8 runner (implement linker)

- evtl. fix spidermonkey runner, but there is a linker that already
  uses the js commandline interface from spidermonkey
