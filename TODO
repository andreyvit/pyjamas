After the europython merge we have still some things to change.

- test on windows (who is willing?)

- fix debug stuff in translated code

- fix all example build scripts

- test all examples

- move all python library modules implemented for js into pyjs/lib

- move all builtin modules implemented for js into pyjs/builtin

- fix v8 runner (implement linker)

- evtl. fix spidermonkey runner, but there is a linker that already
  uses the js commandline interface from spidermonkey

  [lkcl: yeah, but the commandline interface can't interact with
   python modules.  i strongly recommend dropping cmd-line and using
   python-spidermonkey.]

- implement Backquote in translator

- implement classes inside classes in translator

From http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas/issues, for 0.6 release:

97  Enhancement ui.Tree Widgets have too much whitespace around their contents
200 Enhancement Datetime example
209 Defect      Broke tests, --boilerplate-path needed

49  Defect      __pygwt_onBadProperty is not defined        

Python Builtins TODO
---------------

translator support for:

    * GenExpr and GenExprInner
        - if any(isinstance(child, Node) for child in node.getChildren()):
        - write(', '.join(repr(child) for child in node.getChildren()))

    * Conditional in classes:
        class foo:
            if True:
                def fn(self):
                    pass


#234 from Beni Cherniavsky:

Python builtins missing under pyjs:

Easy to implement:
    apply (somewhat deprecated)
    basestring (String should do the job?)
    bin (new in 2.6)
    bytes (alias to str in 2.6)
    globals
    next
    print (under from __future__ import print_function)
    reduce
    reversed
    sorted
    zip

Require work to implement:
    buffer (deprecated, irrelevant)
    bytearray (new in 2.6)
    coerce (somewhat deprecated)
    complex
    format
    frozenset
    id
    intern
    iter
    locals
    long
    property
    set
    unichr
    unicode
    vars
    xrange
    zip

Easy but not needed without interactive prompt:
    copyright
    credits
    exit
    help
    license
    quit

Very hard / impossible within PyJS:
    compile [lkcl: can be done with skulpt]
    eval (very hard) [lkcl: can be done with skulpt]
    execfile (very hard)
    file
    input
    open
    raw_input
    reload
