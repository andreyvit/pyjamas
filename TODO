After the europython merge we have still some things to change.

- test on windows (who is willing?)

- fix debug stuff in translated code

- fix all example build scripts

- test all examples

- move all python library modules implemented for js into pyjs/lib

- move all builtin modules implemented for js into pyjs/builtin

- fix v8 runner (implement linker)

- evtl. fix spidermonkey runner, but there is a linker that already
  uses the js commandline interface from spidermonkey

  [lkcl: yeah, but the commandline interface can't interact with
   python modules.  i strongly recommend dropping cmd-line and using
   python-spidermonkey.]
