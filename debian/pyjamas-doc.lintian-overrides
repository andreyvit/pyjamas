# lkcl 01sep2009: justification for not creating pyjamas-doc.doc-base
#
# The Pyjamas Documentation package contains the web site and the examples,
# rather than any "official" debian-style-conformant documentation.
# There's no .txt files to put into doc-base; there's no html either
# (other than the web site's index.html).  Therefore, creating a
# pyjamas-doc.doc-base would be deceptive.
