         2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
         The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
         claims:
              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
              modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
              Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
              as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
              selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
              sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
              Original Code (or portions thereof).

              (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
              effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
              Original Code under the terms of this License.

              (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
              separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
              by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
              combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

         2.2. Contributor Grant.
         Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
         hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license

              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
              display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
              created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
              unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
              and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
              selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
              and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
              of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
              made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
              Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
              Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
              Version (or portions of such combination).

              (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
              effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
              the Covered Code.

              (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
              Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
              3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
              Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
              by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
              Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
              infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
              that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

         3.1. Application of License.
         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
         governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
         Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
         distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
         of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
         copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
         distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
         version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
         an additional document offering the additional rights described in
         Section 3.5.

         3.2. Availability of Source Code.
         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

         3.3. Description of Modifications.
         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

         3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
              intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
              granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
              Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
              distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
              party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
              know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
              the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
              Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
              Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
              (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
              reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
              Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
              interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
              are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
              also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                   (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
              Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
              Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
              Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
              this License.

         3.5. Required Notices.
         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
         location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

         3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

         3.7. Larger Works.
         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
         statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
         the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
         describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
         must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
         extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
         sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
         understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

         6.1. New Versions.
         Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
         and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
         will be given a distinguishing version number.

         6.2. Effect of New Versions.
         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
         other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

         6.3. Derivative Works.
         If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
         only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
         governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
         the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
         "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
         license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
         and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
         contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
         Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
         Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
         Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
         this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

         COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
         WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
         DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
         THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
         IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
         YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
         COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
         OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
         ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

         8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

         8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
         or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
         You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

         (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
         shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
         agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
         royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
         Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
         the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
         of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
         mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
         is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
         Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
         the 60 day notice period specified above.

         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
         and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
         sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
         Participant.

         8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
         alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
         granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
         into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
         license.

         8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
         all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
         which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
         prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
         DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
         OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
         ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
         CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
         WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
         COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
         INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
         LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
         RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
         PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
         EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
         THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

         The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
         48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
         software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
         terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
         C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
         all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
         rights set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
         matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
         necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
         California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
         any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
         With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
         or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
         States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
         subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
         District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
         California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
         without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
         Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
         Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
         shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
         License.

    12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

         As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
         responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
         out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
         work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
         responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
         shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

         Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
         "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
         Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
         Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
         by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
