Current Release: 0.6~pre3
---------------

A third alpha release is being done due to the large number of contributions:
over 125 items are in the CHANGELOG since the 0.5p1 stable release.
The TODO list is now officially cleared: this is likely to be the last
prerelease.  Thank you to everyone who's helped highlight issues.

Pyjamas
-------

Pyjamas is a port of Google Web Toolkit to Python, and thus enables
the development of AJAX applications in Python.

For more information, see:

    http://pyjs.org

Pyjamas-Desktop
---------------

Pyjamas runs your application in a Web Browser (as javascript); Pyjamas-Desktop
runs exactly the same python application on the Desktop (as python)

    http://pyjd.org

Release 0.6 of Pyjamas also incorporates Pyjamas-Desktop directly into
the Pyjamas Distribution.  To use Pyjamas-Desktop there are three choices,
with more planned (MacOSX PyObjC; KDE's PyKHTML).

1) - Gecko / XulRunner

install hulahop and python-xpcom.  hulahop is distributed with
both Debian and Ubuntu; python-xpcom is part of XULRunner and is
also distributed with both Debian and Ubuntu.  Other users should
investigate the installation instructions for python-xpcom and
hulahop for the operating system of their choice on the appropriate
web sites.

2) - PyWebKitGtk

you will need a patched version of pywebkitgtk:
http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/issues/detail?id=13

you will need a patched version of webkit:
http://github.com/lkcl/webkit/16401.master

Detailed build instructions are available on http://pyjd.org

3) - MSHTML (experimental!)

For Windows users, all that's required, other than installing python
and Internet Explorer, is two further packages: PyWin32 and Win32 comtypes.

They can be downloaded here:
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

The MSHTML version primarily works, but the differences between IE and
other browser engines are shining through, load and clear!  Reports
using IE8 would be appreciated.
