Current Release: 0.6
---------------

With over 140 items in the CHANGELOG since the 0.5p1 stable release,
Pyjamas 0.6 is finally out.  Thank you to everyone who's helped
highlight issues.

Pyjamas
-------

Pyjamas is a port of Google Web Toolkit to Python, and thus enables
the development of Rich Media AJAX applications in Python, with no
need for special browser plugins.  Pyjamas contains a stand-alone
python-to-javascript compiler, and also a Widget Set API that looks
very similar to Desktop Widget Set APIs (such as PyQT4 or PyGTK2).

Known bugs: http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas/issues
            #227, #228, #229, #230 and #232

Pyjamas-Desktop
---------------

Pyjamas runs your application in a Web Browser (as javascript);Pyjamas-Desktop
runs exactly the same python application on the Desktop (as python)

Release 0.6 of Pyjamas also incorporates Pyjamas-Desktop directly into
the Pyjamas Distribution.  To use Pyjamas-Desktop there are three choices,
with more planned [MacOSX PyObjC; KDE's PyKHTML].

1) - Gecko / XulRunner

install hulahop and python-xpcom.  hulahop is distributed with
both Debian and Ubuntu; python-xpcom is part of XULRunner and is
also distributed with both Debian and Ubuntu.  Other users should
investigate the installation instructions for python-xpcom and
hulahop for the operating system of their choice on the appropriate
web sites.

2) - PyWebKitGtk

you will need a patched version of pywebkitgtk:
http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/issues/detail?id=13

you will need a patched version of webkit:
http://github.com/lkcl/webkit/16401.master

Detailed build instructions are available on http://pyjd.org

3) - MSHTML (experimental!)

For Windows users, all that's required, other than installing python
and Internet Explorer, is one further packages: Win32 "comtypes".

Win32 "comtypes" can be downloaded here:
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/

The MSHTML version primarily works.  Reports using IE8's MSHTML
engine would be appreciated.

Known bugs: the use of Tab to cycle through Keyboard Focus elements
            is ineffective; onkeyup and onkeydown events are unresponsive,
            but oddly onkeypress event handling works.
